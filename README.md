## Biggest struggle:
The part that gave me the most trouble and was the most fulfilling was the sorting on the team stats page tables. It was the only thing in the app that really needed its own .js file. The basic principle behind the sorting I used takes each Colum seperate and compares it with the one under it continuously until they are sorted, and then deletes and replaces them in order.
